Shinden Fudo Ryu

Shinden Fudo Ryu, also known as Fudo Ryu, literally translates as “Tradition of the Immovable God.” It is one of the classical Japanese Jujutsu schools (Koryu) incorporated into the curricula of the Bujinkan, Genbukan, Jinenkan, and AKBAN. Shinden Fudo Ryu is divided primarily into dakentaijutsu (striking methods) and jutaijutsu (grappling methods), each with its own characteristic kata, strikes, locks, throws, and weapon segments. Historically, it was the first art that Takamatsu Toshitsugu-who later collected and transmitted many of the Takamatsu-den Koryu-studied under Toda Shinryuken Masamitsu.

Shinden Fudo Ryu Techniques
The teachings of Shinden Fudo Ryu are traditionally grouped into two main categories:

Jutaijutsu - the older name for jujutsu, focusing on grappling, throws, locks, and controls.
Dakentaijutsu - striking methods that often appear direct and strong, using the body as a weapon.
Dakentaijutsu training is further subdivided into Ten no Kata, Chi no Kata, and Shizen Shigoku no Kata (sometimes called Shizen Chigoku no Kata). Each of these levels has distinct forms (kata) that emphasize strikes, throws, and locks, often starting from natural postures (shizen or fudoza) with minimal formal stances.

Jutaijutsu (Grappling Methods)
Jutaijutsu in Shinden Fudo Ryu is characterized by controlling locks, throws, and subtle manipulations of posture. Historically called “Jujutsu,” it trains the practitioner to maintain a natural stance, adapt quickly, and apply powerful leverage-based techniques without formal stances. Jutaijutsu segments can include rope-tying (hojojutsu) and specialized weapon defenses.

Characteristics
Shinden Fudo Ryu features the use of nature as an ally in both conditioning and application. Practitioners often strike with the entire body, moving fluidly from locks to throws to kicks and back again. While it may appear “hard” due to directness of strikes, the system also emphasizes relaxed power, minimal telegraphing, and stable posture (shizen or fudoza). Larger weapons such as the ono (axe), o-tsuchi (war hammer), and naginata are also part of its curriculum.

History
Izumo Kanja Yoshiteru is credited as the founder (and first soke) of Shinden Fudo Ryu, tracing back to the 12th century. Early influences included elements of Chinese Kempo, which are still partly visible in certain striking forms. Over time, many recognized names became soke of the school, contributing additional weapon methods (like yari and ono) and hojojutsu.

The 24th soke, Toda Shinryuken Masamitsu, was famously a sword instructor to the Tokugawa Shogunate and grandfather to Takamatsu Toshitsugu. Takamatsu Sensei inherited and refined Fudo Ryu as part of his broader Takamatsu-den teachings. The present-day lineage is continued by Hatsumi Masaaki.

Rules from the Densho
Know that endurance is simply a puff of smoke.
Know that the way of men is justice.
Forsake greed and comfort; be content with self-sufficiency.
Regard sadness and malice as natural laws. Seek the enlightenment of the immovable heart.
Never stray from loyalty, respect for parents, and mastery of both pen and sword.
These precepts are the Fudo Ryu Dojo Kun, recorded in Meiji 23 (1891) by Toda Shinryuken Masamitsu.

Additional Techniques
Many other Shinden Fudo Ryu techniques exist outside the main kata sets, including methods such as Gokuraku otoshi, Jinchu nage, Koromo gaeshi, and various armlock and wristlock transitions (e.g., Hon gyaku jime, Ude ori, Kimon dori, Take ori). These are sometimes grouped under Jutaijutsu or Dakentaijutsu, depending on their emphasis.

Kukishinden Ryu

Kukishin Ryuu (九鬼神流 ) or Kukishinden Ryû The Nine demons school is a Japanese martial arts school that forms an important part of the Takamatsu den ninjutsu syllabus.

Characteristics Of Kukishin Ryu
The Kukishin Ryu school technical syllabus includes battlefield weapons with the sword, the long fighting stick (Bo), the lance (Yari) and the Japanese halbred (Naginata). Also practiced are techniques for throwing projectiles (Shuriken), armor-wearing methods, and the basis for this work, Taijutsu (体術), empty-handed martial techniques.

In many of its lineages, Kukishinden Ryu especially highlights the use of the rokushaku bo (six-foot staff) as a primary weapon, incorporating strikes, sweeps, thrusts, and locks with fluid body movement. One of the ryu’s hallmarks is the adaptation of weapon strategies for both armored and unarmored combat scenarios. This approach allows practitioners to transfer skills between smaller weapons (like the hanbo) and larger battlefield arms (like the naginata) with minimal adjustments to posture and distancing.

History of Kukishinden Ryu
The Kuki family line started from Ryushin Yakushimaru, a member of the Fujiwara clan. Ryushin Yakushimaru studied Shugendo and the martial arts of Shinden Fujiwara Musou ryuu, Kuji-hihou and Onmyo-do.

After the battle at Kuragari-Touge, where he saved the Emperor Godaigo, the emperor changed his family name from Fujiwara to Ku-ki or literally Ku-Kami, the nine demons.

The school's lineage is well documented in the Bugei Ryuha Daijiten, the Japanese compendium of martial systems written in 1963. It has different branches outside of the Takamatsu den schools.

Over time, the name Kukishinden Ryu came to be used (especially under the Takamatsu-den lineage) to emphasize the “divine transmission” aspect of the system. The Kuki family’s historical background also involved naval warfare and castle defense, influencing certain tactical approaches within the ryu. Many surviving forms rely on strong footwork, angular strikes, and an ability to switch from weapon-based attacks to grappling. Due to its extensive curriculum, Kukishin Ryu is often regarded as one of the most weapon-rich schools in the traditional ninjutsu repertoire.

Takagi Yoshin Ryu

Takagi Yoshin Ryu is a Jujutsu school. The techniques are designed to be applied in a very fast manner so the opponent cannot roll or escape. It is believed that it was a school for bodyguards. The school was organized by Takagi Oriemon Shigenobu, born 1635.

Takagi Yoshin Ryu jujutsu is also known as Takagi Yoshin Ryu jutaijutsu. (Bujinkan)

In the Genbukan, the line is called Hon Tai Takagi Yoshin Ryu Jutaijutsu, which is a different line, though through the Takamatsuden line.


As with most other koryu, the densho (scrolls) are arranged in a particular order, and each waza (technique), kata (forms), etc are supposed to be learnt in the same order, mastering one before going on to the next one.

Togakure Ryu

Togakure Ryu (戸隠流), (The hidden entrance school), is a Ninjutsu Techniques school that was founded about nine hundred years ago by Daisuke Nishina (Togakure), who learned Shugendo practices as well as Hakuun ryu Ninjutsu from Kagakure Doshi. Daisuke Nishina existence has been verified by Koyama Ryutaro in a period work.

The school contained Yon-po Hiden (Four Secrets): Senban Shuriken (Four pointed throwing star), Shuko and Ashiko . Shinodake (A tube used as a snorkel or blowgun) and Kyoketsu Shoge (A peculiar blade attached to cord which is in turn attached to a heavy ring) and Taijutsu. The Togakure Ryu school contains a unique syllabus of Karuwaza.

History
In 1182, during the Japanese Genpei War, at the end of the Heian Period, Minamoto no Yoshinaka, a general from the mountainous Nagano region of Japan, captured the capital city of Kyoto. After this victory, he found himself under attack by his cousin Yoshitsune. When Yoshitsune's troops successfully crossed the Uji river, a key strategic defense for the capital, Yoshinaka withdrew, only to be killed as his horse fell through the ice of a frozen rice paddy.

After Yoshinaka's defeat, one of his samurai retainers, Daisuke Nishina of Togakure Village escaped to the mountains of Iga in south central Japan. Nishina's native village of Togakure is now known as Togakushi, Nagano, and was an early center of Shugendo training. It may be that Nishina engaged in such training, but the records of the Togakure ryu do not mention it. The mountains provided an easy place to hide from the enemy troops, who still searched for Yoshinaka's forces. Daisuke Nishina, who subsequently changed his name to Daisuke Togakure, later became known as the first Souke (family head) of Togakure-ryu ninjutsu.

Ironically, Yoshitsune was later overthrown by his brother Yoritomo. After escaping capture by Yoritomo's forces, he founded the Yoshitsune-ryu of ninjutsu. The Yoshitsune-ryu later died out, along with many other famous ninjutsu ryu.

The ninja families of Iga grew to become a great part of Japan's military history. Lending their support to Tokugawa Ieyasu, they were able to aid in the establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate and were recruited to many government posts, including police, bodyguards, and intelligence agents.

Gyokushin Ryu

The School of the Jeweled Heart
Gyokushin-Ryuu Ninjutsu is a branch of koshi jutsu and is believed to have been founded by Sasaki Goeman Teruyoshi, a student of Gyokko-Ryuu. The methods of Kumogakure-Ryuu (blocks, punches, and stances) are very similar to those of Gyokko-Ryu.

Sasaki Gendayu was in the service of the Daimyou of Kishu and received a salary of 200 kokuu (Japanese capacity for rice, one kokuu equals about 180 liters of rice) per year, later even 400 kokuu. Like his father, he was probably very capable of Gyokko-Ryuu.

The Gyokushin-Ryuu was taught in secret, in the Kishu and Takeda provinces. Sometime in the 17th century, he came into contact with the Togakure-Ryuu and the Toda family. After the style was passed down to Toda Nobutsuna, it was no longer kept secret.

Little is known about the combat system of the Gyokushin-Ryuu. The system was more focused on espionage and other Ninja skills than combat.

The Gyokushin-Ryuu is known for its use of the nagenawa (lasso).

Kano Jigoro, the founder of judo, was a friend of Takamatsu Sensei. It is believed that Takamatsu taught Gyokushin-Ryuu as a guest at the Kodokan.

Gikan Ryu

Gikan-ryuu Koppoujutsu (義鑑流骨法術) is a medieval Japanese school of martial arts allegedly established in the 16th century by Uryu Hangan Gikanbo (瓜生判官義鑑坊). Koppoujutsu means attacks against bones.

Gikan-ryuu Koppoujutsu is based on martial arts skills and techniques that Uryu Hangan Gikanbo learned from Sougyoku Kan Ritsushi, Soke of Gyokko-ryuu and Kotou-ryuu, one of the inputs for the Ninjutsu of the takamatsu den schools.

Kumogakure Ryu

Kumogakure Ryû, 雲隠れ流, “Hidden School” was founded in the mid 1500's by Iga Heinaizaemon No Jo Ienaga who was said to have changed his name to Kumogakure Hoshi. It may have originated as a school of thought based on non-violence. It is said that the phrase "Shikin Haramitsu Daikomyo" comes from this ryu and reflects both Buddhist and Shinto attitudes.

Characteristics
This is one of the three ninpo ryuha in the Bujinkan and is known for its Tobi (jumping techniques) and Kamayari (sickled spear). The kamayari and another special weapon, Ippon Sugi Noburi (a 25cm long metal tube with three spikes, and a long chain with hooks at its ends throught it) were used for combat and for climbing - often on ships.

This Ryu is famous for its Demon Masks that were worn to play on the myth surounding ninja and scare the enemy. A technique rarely if ever seen in other systems was Kikaku ken - demon horn strike (head butt).

When going into battle, ninja of this ryu wore armored sleeves to protect themselves Kumogakure Ryu also taught various survival techniques such as making fire in wet weather This school is scarcely seen today and some believe that very little of it has survived to the present day.

History of Kumogakure Ninpo
Kumogakure Ryu Ninjutsu was founded in the mid 1500's by Iga Heinaizaemon No Jo Ienaga who was said to have changed his name to Kumogakure Hoshi. It may have originated as a school of thought based on non-violence. It is said that the phrase "Shikin Haramitsu Daikomyo" comes from this ryu and reflects both Buddhist and Shinto attitudes.

The taijutsu of Kumogakure Ryu is very similar to Togakure Ryu. The Kumogakure Ryu may have been created by the Toda family (also of Togkakure Ryu) in the 1600's, as a ninjutsu school of thought- centering it's techniques on the non-violent side of Ninpo. (The Togakure Ryu teaches that violence is to be avoided). The ninja of Kumogakure Ryu went into combat wearing armored sleeves to protect themselves. Another interesting feature of the ryu was the Demon Mask, sometimes worn by members of the system. Kikaku-ken (Demon Horn Fist, or head butt) gives rise to another theory of the Demon Mask. One of the special weapons of the style is the kamayari, or hooked spear. Used in combat against swordsmen, the hooks were used to parry and trap the incoming blades. It was also used to hook opponents from above. The Kumogakure Ryu densho mentions a ninja named Sarutobi Sasuke, who used the kamayari when leaping from tree to tree, hooking it onto the branches.

Another Kumogakure Ryu speciality involved survival training, and being able to light fires under all conditions.

Iga Heinaizaemon had a son, Kami Hattori Heitaro Koreyuki, who was the ancestor of Hattori Hanzo, the famous ninja.
