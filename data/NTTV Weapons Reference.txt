# Shuriken Throwing Basics
## Source: Ninja Training TV | Reformatted for LLM Ingestion
---

## 📌 Section: Overview
### Topic: Dual Use of Shuriken

- There are two primary ways to use a shuriken:
  - **Daken-jutsu (打剣術)** – Throwing techniques
  - **Shoken-jutsu (掌剣術)** – Hand-to-hand techniques

Both methods are based on the same context: a concealed blade (or object) is used in defense, either thrown or used in close combat.

🎯 *Principle:* Train to be prepared for either application — throwing or striking — without reliance on circumstance.

---

## 📌 Section: Daken-jutsu
### Topic: Throwing Techniques

- **Definition**: The art of throwing an object — traditionally a blade, but can be anything.
- **Improvised Weapons**: Pencil, chopstick, paintbrush, tool — anything small and throwable.
- **Advantage**: Faster than drawing a weapon (e.g. sword, bow, firearm).

#### 🧭 Functional Range
- Effective range is up to **10 meters**.
- Traditional practice limit: **3 tatami mats** distance = **sangen (三間)** ≈ **5.4 meters / 17 feet**.
- Extended skill benchmarks:
  - **Yongen (四間)** = ~7.2 meters / 22 feet
  - **Goken (五間)** = ~9 meters / 29 feet

#### 📏 Japanese Distance Terms
| Term   | Meaning         | Approximate Distance     |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Ken**     | 1 mat / 1 reach | ~1.8m / 6ft            |
| **Sangen**  | 3 ken            | ~5.4m / 17ft           |
| **Yongen**  | 4 ken            | ~7.2m / 22ft           |
| **Goken**   | 5 ken            | ~9m / 29ft             |

## 📌 Section: Biomechanics
### Topic: Throwing Motion

- **Arm Mechanics**: Throwing = circular motion around shoulder. Shoulder is the fixed axis.
- **Punching vs Throwing**:
  - Punch = Linear force
  - Throw = Rotational speed

#### ✅ Throwing Form Guidelines
1. Do **not** rely on straight extension (as in punching).
2. Use full-body rotation for power.
3. Ensure the wrist flick aligns with release for control.

🧠 *Tip:* Think of the throw like casting a fishing rod — smooth arc, timed release.

---

## 📌 Section: Targeting & Practice
### Topic: Effective Practice Habits

- Practice throwing at consistent distances (Ken/Sangen/Yongen).
- Track success by accuracy, penetration (if using real metal), and consistency.
- Consider trajectory vs speed:
  - Close = fast release
  - Far = more arc and wrist control

🎯 *Visualization:* Imagine a line extending from shoulder to target. The shuriken follows this path.

---

## 📌 Section: Shoken-jutsu
### Topic: Close-Quarters Application

- **Definition**: Using the shuriken in hand-to-hand combat.
- Can function as a surprise striking tool (e.g., palm strike with metal edge).
- Use like a yawara stick or pressure point implement.
- Often concealed in palm or sleeve.

⚠️ *Partner awareness essential — train with safe replicas.*

---

## 📌 Section: Training Mindset
### Topic: Philosophy of Shuriken Use

- A true ninja is ready to use any object in the environment as a weapon.
- Shuriken should not be relied upon solely for combat, but as a tool of timing, deception, and disruption.
- The mindset is not “I throw a weapon,” but rather “I use the moment.”

🧘 *Zanshin* (残心) — Remaining mind/spirit — applies **after** the throw.

## 📌 Section: Types of Shuriken
### Topic: Classification and Features

Shuriken come in several forms, generally categorized into two main groups:

---

### 1. **Bo-Shuriken (棒手裏剣)**
- **Shape**: Straight spike — like a needle, dart, or nail.
- **Material**: Usually steel or iron.
- **Size**: Typically 12–18 cm long (~5–7 inches).
- **Throwing**: Usually single-spin (ken or sangen).
- **Grip**: Thrown from the center or tail end.
- **Ryu Examples**:
  - Togakure-ryū used bo-shuriken hidden in the *sleeves* or *pant legs*.

🛠 *Common shapes*: square, round, octagonal cross-section.

---

### 2. **Hira-Shuriken (平手裏剣)**
- **Shape**: Flat, bladed — the classic “ninja star.”
- **Blades**: Typically 4 to 8 points.
- **Material**: Forged steel; sharpened on edges.
- **Throwing**: More of a slicing rotation; good at short ranges.
- **Grip**: Between the index and thumb; thrown in a flicking motion.

⚠️ Often used for distraction, cutting skin, or applying toxins — not primary killing tools.

---

### 3. **Senban Shuriken (旋盤手裏剣)**
- **Specific subtype** of hira-shuriken.
- **Shape**: Four-pointed “square” star with sharp corners.
- **Unique Use**: May be stuck in the ground for traps, or thrown edge-first.
- **Historical Use**: Prominent in Togakure-ryū.

---

### 4. **Needle Shuriken / Hari-gata (針型手裏剣)**
- **Shape**: Very thin needle-like; may resemble large sewing needles.
- **Tactic**: Excellent for precise, stealthy insertion (e.g., behind the ear, through thin clothing).
- **Often used with poison.**

---

### 5. **Modern Improvised Throwing Tools**
- Chopsticks, pens, nails, allen wrenches, hex keys — anything can be trained as a shuriken if:
  - It fits in the hand
  - Is balanced or controllable
  - Can pierce, distract, or strike with intent

🥋 *Philosophy*: “Anything in the environment can be a tool of survival if your spirit is prepared.”

---

### 🧠 Practical Advice for Training
| Type           | Range      | Rotation | Application       |
|----------------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| Bo-shuriken    | Mid-Long   | 1–2 spin | Penetration       |
| Hira-shuriken  | Short      | Rapid    | Distraction, slice|
| Senban         | Short      | Flat spin| Trap, utility     |
| Improvised     | Varies     | N/A      | Training mindset  |

---

🧷 *Pro Tip:* Store shuriken safely in a cloth wrap or wooden container to avoid edge dulling or accidental injury.
